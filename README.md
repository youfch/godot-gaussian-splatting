# gdgs: Godot Gaussian Splatting

Maintainer: ReconWorldLab

[简体中文说明](README_CN.md)

Current plugin version: `1.1.0`

`gdgs` is a Godot 4 Gaussian Splatting plugin built around `CompositorEffect` and compute shaders.

It imports supported 3D Gaussian Splat assets, places them in a scene through `GaussianSplatNode`, and composites the result with the regular 3D scene using scene depth.

## Demo

## Features

- Import supported Gaussian assets from `.ply`, `.compressed.ply`, `.splat`, and `.sog`.
- Convert different source formats into a shared GPU-ready Gaussian resource.
- Center imported Gaussian data by default during resource build.
- Apply a default `-180` degree Z rotation on `GaussianSplatNode`.
- Render one or more `GaussianSplatNode` instances in the same scene.
- Composite Gaussian Splat rendering with standard Godot 3D content through `WorldEnvironment.compositor`.
- Mix Gaussian results against the scene depth buffer.
- Preview in the editor and manipulate the node with a gizmo.
- Built-in debug views for alpha, color, GS depth, scene depth, and depth rejection.

## Requirements

- Godot `4.4` or newer.
- `Forward Plus` rendering backend.
- A desktop GPU and driver with compute shader support.
- A supported Gaussian asset in one of the formats listed below.

## Installation

1. Create an `addons` folder in your Godot project if it does not already exist.
2. Copy the `gdgs` folder from this repository into your project as `addons/gdgs`.
3. Open the project in Godot.
4. Go to `Project > Project Settings > Plugins`.
5. Enable the `gdgs` plugin.

After installation, the plugin root should be available at `res://addons/gdgs`.

## Quick Start

1. Add a supported Gaussian asset to your project. The repository includes `demo.ply`, `demo.compressed.ply`, and `demo.sog` as sample assets.
2. Wait for Godot to import it into a resource.
3. Add a `GaussianSplatNode` to your scene.
4. Assign the imported resource to the `gaussian` property of `GaussianSplatNode`.
5. Add a `WorldEnvironment` node to the scene.
6. Create a `Compositor` resource on `WorldEnvironment.compositor`.
7. Add a `CompositorEffect` to that `Compositor`, and set its script to `res://addons/gdgs/postprocess.gd`.
8. Run the scene.

## Scene Setup Notes

- `GaussianSplatNode` stores transform and resource references. Actual rendering is performed by the compositor pass, not by Godot's standard mesh pipeline.
- Multiple `GaussianSplatNode` instances are supported and are rendered together in the same Gaussian pass.
- Imported Gaussian data is centered around its average position during resource build, so scenes start closer to the origin by default.
- `GaussianSplatNode` starts with a default Z rotation of `-180` degrees. If your source data already matches your scene orientation, adjust the node transform after adding it.
- If you replace the source asset contents, reimport it in Godot so the generated resource stays in sync.

## Post Process Parameters

The compositor effect script is `res://addons/gdgs/postprocess.gd`.

- `alpha_cutoff`: Pixels with alpha below this threshold are ignored during final composition.
- `depth_bias`: Small bias used when comparing GS depth against scene depth.
- `depth_test_min_alpha`: Minimum GS alpha required before depth rejection is applied.
- `debug_view`: Debug output mode.

`debug_view` options:

- `Composite`: Final composited result.
- `GS Alpha`: Gaussian alpha buffer.
- `GS Color`: Gaussian color buffer.
- `GS Depth`: Gaussian depth buffer.
- `Scene Depth`: Scene depth buffer.
- `Depth Reject Mask`: Shows which GS pixels are rejected by depth testing.

## Supported Formats

### Standard Gaussian `.ply`

The importer supports binary little-endian Gaussian Splat `.ply` files with these properties:

- Position: `x`, `y`, `z`
- DC color coefficients: `f_dc_0`, `f_dc_1`, `f_dc_2`
- Remaining SH coefficients: `f_rest_0` to `f_rest_44`
- Opacity: `opacity`
- Scale: `scale_0`, `scale_1`, `scale_2`
- Rotation: `rot_0`, `rot_1`, `rot_2`, `rot_3`

### `.compressed.ply`

- Supported through the dedicated compressed PLY decoder.
- Detected automatically from the `.compressed.ply` suffix or packed vertex properties.

### Legacy `.splat`

- Supported for older Gaussian Splat record-based assets.

### `.sog`

- Supports SOG version `2` archives.

This importer is meant for Gaussian Splatting style assets, not generic point cloud files.

## Repository Layout

- `gdgs/`: Plugin root in this repository. Copy this folder into your Godot project as `addons/gdgs`.
- `gdgs/gaussian`: Importers, decoders, and Gaussian resource definitions.
- `gdgs/node`: Scene node and editor gizmo.
- `gdgs/rendering`: Render manager, rendering context, and compute shaders.
- `gdgs/postprocess.gd`: Compositor effect entry point.
- `demo.ply`: Sample standard Gaussian PLY asset.
- `demo.compressed.ply`: Sample compressed Gaussian PLY asset.
- `demo.sog`: Sample SOG asset.

## Known Limitations

- The plugin currently targets desktop `Forward Plus` rendering only.
- Rendering depends on Godot's compositor and compute pipeline, so compatibility and mobile renderers are not supported.
- The render manager currently lives as a shared root-level runtime manager, so very complex editor multi-scene or multi-viewport workflows may still need additional validation.
- Standard `.ply` support expects binary little-endian Gaussian Splat data, not arbitrary point cloud layouts.
- `.sog` support currently targets version `2` archives only.
